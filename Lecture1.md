# Gnostic Yahweh: The Mystic-Pagan Roots of the Bible (discussion group)
# Lecture I: Overview

## Introduction: Authorship
### Who wrote the Bible?
- Who wrote the Bible? Which books were written by whom? What were the political, spiritual, and societal agendas of the various groups involved?
- Biblical inconsistencies are representative of competing schools, struggling to define orthodoxy. Some examples in the narrative:
  - two creation stories
  - various names of God throughout Genesis specifically ( *El Shadadi*, *Elohim*, *Yahweh*, etc.)
  - grammatical fragmentation indication of ancient copy-paste redacting
- Evidence within the Bible itself that the Bible was redacted: reforms of Hezekiah and the 'discovery' of the entire book of Deuteronomy
- Later evidence in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and the re-telling of Hebraic history
- Religious syncreticism with Canaanite paganism attested to in the Kingdom of Israel and Judah

### The Documentary Hypothesis
![Alt text](http://donsnotes.com/religion/images/bible-pent.png)

- The **Documentary Hypothesis** is an academic theory put forth in the 19th century, positing that there are four to five main schools that wrote the original Torah/Pentateuch (5 books of Moses), all based on an earlier oral tradition and fragmented sources.
- If Moses wrote the entire Torah, he would have to describe his own death, the ascension of his brother Aaron, the various rebellions and failings on the part of the Hebrews against their own god.
- This theory is based on scientific linguistic analysis, and is heavily informed by studies in historical linguistics and etymology  within the Semitic languages
- Yes, linguistic analysis realizes that there are many different styles of writing that an individual author uses, but this indicates different authors. The same kind of techniques are used in forensic textual analysis (ransom notes, wills, other forged documents etc)

- The authors:
  - J: Yahwist: storytelling, narration, folk tales
  - E: Elohist: fear of God, absolute unwavering loyalty, deterministic
  - P: Priestly: ceremonies, rituals, religious and social law
  - D: Deuteronomist: Reforms of King Hezekiah, oratory
  - R: Redactor: A later editing process perhaps during the Ezra-Nehemiah era, responsible for assembling Pentateuch together in a more coherent dialog

### Monotheism or Henotheism?
- The Pentateuch, and much of the Old Testament as a whole with the important exception of the books of the Prophets, doesn't appear to have the concept of monotheism rigourously implemented. Rather than denying the existence of other gods, it accepts their existence, but holds that worship of the ancestral god of Abraham to be paramount, and that serving this god will be rewarded.
- This god is thus not omnipotent, omniscient or even omnipresent
- This Henotheistic model becomes problematic in the Babylonian exile: is your god indeed all powerful, if the Assyrians and Babylonians were able to destroy your kingdom? Historically, this would be a problem for cities patroned by particular gods (indeed, the Persians destroyed the cult of Marduk upon taking Babylon, almost destroying the cult of Marduk)
- Only much later in the time of Jesus, would other pagan gods be regarded as demonic forces, but even during the exile, prophets were beginning to suggest that the Babylonian exile was God's punishment for Israel's transgressions.

### Overview of Ancient Semitic Deities
- However, many of these stories share themes, memes, and a general cultural context with surrounding religious-cultural practices.
- Marduk - Heroic "alpha-God",
